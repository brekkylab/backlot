"""Atlassian Cloud's error envelope.

Atlassian clients (atlassian-python-api, which mcp-atlassian uses) parse an error body as Atlassian
Cloud's shape — Confluence's ``raise_for_status`` does ``response.json()["message"]`` — so FastAPI's
default ``{"detail": …}`` turns every error into a cryptic ``KeyError: 'message'`` inside the client
rather than the error Backlot meant to report. Both Jira's ``errorMessages`` list and Confluence's
scalar ``message`` are emitted, since one envelope serves both APIs here.
